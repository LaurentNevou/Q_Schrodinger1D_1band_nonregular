# Q_Schrodinger1D_1band_nonregular
1D Schrodinger solver with effective mass on non regular grid
This code solves the time independent Schrodinger equation in 1D with effective mass, m(z) on a NON-REGULAR GRID.

It uses 2 different algorithms that can be switched ON/OFF:

-> The FDM: Finite Difference Method

-> The Scanning/Shooting method using the Euler approach

A database of the most common semiconductor III-V , IV-IV and II-VI is provided and can be adjusted.

A strain model is included.
